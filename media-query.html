            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen 
                many afflictions in the course of my days, nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had 
                a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days.</p>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hearken, O ye people of my church, saith the voice of him who dwells on high, and whose eyes are upon all men; yea, 
                verily I say: Hearken ye people from afar; and ye that are upon the islands of the sea, listen together.
